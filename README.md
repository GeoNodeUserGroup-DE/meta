This repo is for documenting and discussing how we organize ourselves, including the organization of this GitHub Organization.

## Purpose

## Members

### Permissions & Visibility

+ All repos under this organization are "private" an thus only visible for
  members of this GitHub Organization (but see [Attention](#Attention))

+ All members of this organization have
  ["admin"](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization)
  access to all repositories. This is convenient but allows for potentially
  destructive actions. <mark>Please take care</mark>.

## Attention

## Topics

### GeoNode development: ongoing

### GeoNode development: greater strategy

### GeoNode deployment

#### Kubernetes

#### As a pet

### GeoNode ecosystem
